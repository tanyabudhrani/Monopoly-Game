# Monopoly Game - Test Coverage Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the test coverage achieved by the unit tests written in `MonopolyGameTest.java`. The test suite executed successfully with 10/10 tests passing, ensuring correctness for a significant portion of the Monopoly game model.

## Test Summary
- **Total Tests Executed**: 10
- **Errors**: 0
- **Failures**: 0

Each test corresponds to a specific functionality of the Monopoly game, as described below.

## Features Covered
### Square Functionality
1. **`testGoSquare`**
   - Ensures players receive $1500 when landing on "Go."
2. **`testChanceSquare`**
   - Verifies that landing on a "Chance" square changes the player's money (either gain or loss).
3. **`testIncomeTaxSquare`**
   - Checks the deduction of money when a player lands on an "Income Tax" square.
4. **`testJailSquare`**
   - Confirms that landing on a "Jail" square without being sent to jail does not penalize the player.
5. **`testGoToJailSquare`**
   - Validates the player's transition to the jail position and jail status when landing on the "Go to Jail" square.
6. **`testFreeParkingSquare`**
   - Ensures that landing on "Free Parking" has no financial effect.

### Player Operations
7. **`testPlayerJailOperations`**
   - Covers scenarios for entering and exiting jail, including paying fines or rolling doubles.
8. **`testPlayerPayJailFine`**
   - Verifies that a player can pay a fine to exit jail and updates the money correctly.

### Game Mechanics
9. **`testFullGameTurn`**
   - Simulates a full game turn to ensure the player's position updates correctly after rolling dice.

### GameBoard Customization
10. **`testGameBoardCustomization`**
    - Confirms that the `GameBoard` can be customized by setting new properties.

## Observations
- **Key Focus Areas**: 
  The test cases focus on the interactions between the player, the game board, and square-specific behaviors.
- **Uncovered Areas**:
  The following areas appear to lack direct test coverage:
  - Edge cases for invalid board configurations.
  - Detailed multi-round game simulations with multiple players.
  - Comprehensive property transactions, including purchasing and renting logic.
  - Save/load game functionality.

## Recommendations
- **Additional Test Cases**:
  1. Test all possible outcomes for "Chance" square scenarios to ensure full coverage of random outcomes.
  2. Include edge cases for property transactions, such as a player attempting to purchase without sufficient funds.
  3. Validate game-over conditions and winner announcements.
  4. Test the save and load functionalities for game persistence.

## Conclusion
The current test suite achieves a good baseline of functionality coverage. While most core interactions between players and squares are covered, additional tests are recommended to ensure robustness for all possible game scenarios.
